            <h1>Albert Einstein</h1>
            <p>Albert Einstein was a brilliant physicist who is best known for his theory of relativity, which
                revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and energy. Born in 1879 in Germany, he was curious and
                imaginative from a young age. In 1905, often called his "miracle year," he published papers that
                introduced groundbreaking ideas, including E=mc², which shows that mass can be converted into energy.
